VRA – VOM Resonant Agent

A resonance-based retrieval micro-agent for meaning-driven systems
[Submission for Haystack x MCP Spring 2024]

Overview

The VRA (VOM Resonant Agent) is a novel micro-agent prototype inspired by the Virtual Oscillatory Machine (VOM) model, which replaces keyword or logic-based searches with a resonance-based retrieval mechanism.

It evaluates oscillatory similarity between an input vector and a dataset using three dimensions:
• Frequency (ω) – conceptual signature
• Phase (φ) – temporal/emotional alignment
• Amplitude (A) – intensity or significance of the signal

How it works

Each data point is encoded as an oscillatory vector:

{ "frequency": ω_i, "phase": φ_i, "amplitude": A_i }

The agent receives an input vector:

{ "frequency": ω_0, "phase": φ_0, "amplitude": A_0 }

It computes resonance scores for each target using the formula:

R_i = cos(φ_i - φ_0) * exp(-|ω_i - ω_0|) * (1 - |A_i - A_0|)

The highest R_i is considered the most resonant match. 
Example Output

Input:
{ "frequency": 3.14, "phase": 1.57, "amplitude": 0.90 }

Best match result:
{ "id": "B", "resonance_score": 0.915, "frequency": 3.2, "phase": 1.7, "amplitude": 0.92 }

Applications
• Semantically-aware document or knowledge base search
• Human-AI interaction agents based on felt meaning rather than logic
• Emotional alignment filters in agent-based systems
• A foundation for frequency-based cognition engines (VOG-derived)

Why it’s different

Traditional agents:
• Use keywords or semantic similarity
• Depend on token-level embeddings

VRA:
• Uses frequency–phase–amplitude fields
• Operates on resonance, not logic
• Inspired by an oscillatory model of computation, not Turing logic

Requirements
• Python 3.8+
• NumPy
• Pandas
